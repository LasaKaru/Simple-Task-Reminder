## The Task Reminder Software is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. It utilizes the following technologies:

* C# Programming Language: The application logic is written in C#, a versatile and widely-used programming language.

* WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): WPF is a graphical subsystem for rendering user interfaces in Windows-based applications. It provides a unified programming model for building desktop client applications with rich user interfaces.

* MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture: The application follows the MVVM architectural pattern, which separates the concerns of the user interface (View), application logic (ViewModel), and data model (Model). This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and testability of the application.

* ClosedXML Library: ClosedXML is used for reading and writing Excel files. It provides a simple API for creating and manipulating Excel files without requiring Microsoft Office to be installed.

* RelayCommand: RelayCommand is a custom implementation of the ICommand interface, commonly used in MVVM applications to handle user interactions with the UI elements. It allows binding commands from the ViewModel to the View.

* Overall, the Task Reminder Software provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, and persists task data in an Excel file for easy retrieval and manipulation.
